# Data-Structures
A compilation of school projects from my data structures class.

The general skeletons of each project (methods and some global variables, along with 
the variables stated in the comments above each method) were written and given to me
as a starting point by Michael Leverington, my professor for the course. 

All logic inside of said methods are my own code unless otherwise stated by the comment.

I am very grateful to Michael for his help in understanding all of the data structures
listed. This was one of my favorite courses throughout my entire degree.

If you're reading this Michael and have an issue with how I am displaying these projects
I greatly apologize and please dont hesitate to contact me at avereclipse@gmail.com.
